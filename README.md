# GenWin
 GenWin -- An R Package that defines window or bin boundaries for the analysis of genomic data. Boundaries are based on the inflection points of a cubic smoothing spline fitted to the raw data. Along with defining boundaries, a technique to evaluate results obtained from unequally-sized windows is provided. Applications are particularly pertinent for, though not limited to, genome scans for selection based on variability between populations (e.g. using     Wright's fixations index, Fst, which measures variability in subpopulations relative to the total population).
